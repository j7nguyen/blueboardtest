Here is my beloved dev test for Blueboard. Noteworthy features:

Favoriting
----------

Activities can be favorited by clicking on the 'Add to Favorites' div in the upper-right
corner of the activity's div. It will change to say 'In Favorites' in different colors
as an AJAX request is made to update the database. To change back just click 
what is now 'In Favorites' and it will make another AJAX request while changing
it back.

There is a button at top to only show favorited activities, which then becomes a
button to revert back to showing all activities.
